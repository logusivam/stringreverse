# String Reverse in C++

This project demonstrates a simple C++ program that reverses a given string. It includes a function to reverse the string and a main function to test the reversal functionality.

## Features

- **String Reversal**: A function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
- **Simple and Efficient**: Uses basic C++ constructs for efficient string manipulation.

## Installation

To use this project, simply download or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/logusivam/stringreverse.git
```

Alternatively, you can directly copy the `stringreverse.cpp` file into your project directory.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang, devcpp).

2. Navigate to the project directory and compile the code:
```
g++ stringreverse.cpp -o stringreverse
```

3. Run the compiled executable:
```
./stringreverse
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to input a string and see the reversed output.

## Example
Here is an example of how the program works:
```
Enter a string: hello
Reversed string: olleh
```
